					Entrepreneurship programs provide students with the experience to learn skills that will help them long after school.
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg">
					When discussing modern education many politicians discuss how there should be a focus on "real-world" skills. However what exactly is meant by real world skills as careers require a host of skills. During a recent interview with Jack Beasley, the managing director of the USC/Columbia Incubator, Mr. Beasley gave an interesting insight. He stated how many jobs in the future will be replaced by automation as technology continues to progress. This means many of the jobs that make up our workforce will be replaced. However, jobs that require human specific skills, whether that be sales, creative thinking, or other jobs that humans are superior from, will be protected. Therefore, entrepreneurs and those who own capital will prosper.&nbsp;<br>

					Many of the jobs of the future will require employees and entrepreneurs to think creatively as automation increases.
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg">
					Creativity is a trait that will only become more valuable as advances in automation are made. According to Superintelligence, a book written by Oxford Professor and Director of the Future of Humanity Institute Nick Bolstrom, computers that are modeled after the neural networks of the brain will eventually be able to surpass humans in cognition due to the ability to keep improving hardware. Thus in the near future many jobs that involve repeated tasks will easily be replaced by the technologies created by aspiring entrepreneurs and scientists. Creativity, however, is more difficult to recreate. While it is not impossible to code a robot to be creative, it is much harder and thus will take a much longer time to implement. Thus creativity is important for all members of the work force including employees.<br>

					The stress and sheer amount of tasks associated with running a business teaches students how to properly manage their time.
				</h2>
				<p class="mg-lg">
					While the previous arguments for creating an entrepreneurship program in school focus on the future, proper time management is a skill that is immediately beneficial for students. The stress and continuous deadlines that come with running even a mock business forces students to learn to set priorities and finish their tasks in a timely manner. This skill is learned as students must work in teams to complete the monumental task of creating a business. Thus students eventually learn to split up the workload in a way that optimizes the productivity of the team. This quickly creates bonding between the group and teaches students the importance of having a strong social network.
